In this project, [Reyhan Pamungkas](https://github.com/adhgn) and I attempt to recreate the solutions of the [SMRVIS: Point cloud extraction from 3-D ultrasound for non-destructive testing Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371414251_SMRVIS_Point_cloud_extraction_from_3-D_ultrasound_for_non-destructive_testing) by Tang, L. T. W. for a challenge hosted by UBC Data Science Club in collaboration with DarkVision, a British Columbia-based company that specializes in industrial imaging technology. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ShawnGabriel/3D-Mesh-Reconstruction-From-Point-Clouds).

Importance
=======
The techniques that this project used, was utilized in biomedical imaging such as CT and SPECT scans, but we repurpose it for non-destructive testing of industrial components, such as steel pipes. By detecting manufacturing defects in steel pipes, the framework has industrial applications in quality assurance and safety.
