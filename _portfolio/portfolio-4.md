Introduction to The Challenge
=======
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The techniques that this project used, was utilized in biomedical imaging such as CT and SPECT scans, but we repurpose it for non-destructive testing of industrial components, such as steel pipes. By detecting manufacturing defects in <strong>steel pipes</strong>, the framework has industrial applications in <strong>quality assurance</strong> and <strong>safety</strong>. The challenge didn't provide a definitive guide that told us to recreate the solutions of the SMRVIS Paper, not until 2 days after the challenge was published. Hence, the methodologies tested can be seen as an experimentation phase, as we weren't given clear instructions on how to approach the problem.
