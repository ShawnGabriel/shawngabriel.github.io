My Story 
======
During my highschool years in Indonesia 🇮🇩, I always found excitement and joy in preparing for competitions. The best of months was when I achieved a silver medal for the National Science Olympiad 2022 held by The Ministry of Education, Research, Culture, and Technology, where I placed 14th out of 21560 students nation-wide. Following my triumph, I attended the national selection for the International Earth Science Olympiad in 2023.
