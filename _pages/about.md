The Experiences That Defined Me
======
During my highschool years in Indonesia 🇮🇩, I always found excitement and joy in preparing for competitions. The best of months was when I achieved a silver medal for the National Science Olympiad 2022 held by The Ministry of Education, Research, Culture, and Technology, where I placed 14th out of 21560 students nation-wide. Following my triumph, I attended the national selection for the 2023 International Earth Science Olympiad. It was where I finally had a chance to connect, share interests, and meet my competitive partner for competitions at university!

Fast forward to the Summer of 2024, I discovered my passion for Data Science and Machine Learning! It was then I planned my roadmap for the Data Science Minor program and started competing in Hackathons regarding Data! This is definitely just the beginning. Here's to more revolutionary changes in the world of Data and Artificial Intelligence 🥂🤖
